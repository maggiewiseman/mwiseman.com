							<p>I became a teacher 13 years ago becuase I wanted to have a meaningful impact.  It turns out that learning how people learn is fascinating! I love designing curriculum! I love thinking about how to engage students, how to organize the concepts in a way that will build on prior skills. I love thinking up new test questions that are different than how I've presented the material in class but would show student's ability to apply the information.  I love getting to know kid's learning styles and adapting my approach to them. I love trying out new strategies for reaching students. I've been doing that since the beginning. Here's some of the best.  </p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Inquiry & Constructivism</li>
								<li>Flipping the Classroom</li>
								<li>Standards Based Grading & Mastery Based Learning</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>As I've used new strategies over the years I've come to accept the enormous amount of time it takes to commit and use these strategies or to develop a new course. Yet I have always felt that if I just had the right system, things could be more streamlined, faster, I could spend my time more effetively. And I wonder, can we make adopting new systems and methods easier for teachers?</p>
							
							<p>So I decided to learn to code so I could build the systems myself.  I started with Code Academy to review all that coding stuff I did before I was a teacher.  I learned a little HTML, CSS and Javascript, but it wasn't until I took a course from <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com">Skillcrush</a> and had to build a <a href="http://www.mwiseman.com/projects/music"> responsive site from scratch</a> that I really got a solid grasp of HTML and CSS. It wasn't until I got stuck on chapter 6 of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a> and went looking for help that I found Gordon Zhu's <a href="https://watchandcode.com/">Watch and Code</a>.  So much became so clear after the first free lessons and even more when I built my own todo app (<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d#.lvnu91cr1">even if a puppy had to suffer)</a>. But more than anything at this point, I realized that I needed a team. The jobs that need to be done are big and there are amazing companies out there doing the hard and important work of improving teaching and learning.  So I will keep learning and join one someday!</p>
